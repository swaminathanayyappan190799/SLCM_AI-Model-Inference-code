    "**Grain Quality Check Module Demonstration By Nuvento**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is created for demonstrating functionalities of Artificial Intelligence models created by Nuvento Systems Private Limited for Sohan Lal Commodity Management Agrireach Quality Check Mobile application.It will covers and elaborates about the working functionality of two AI models which are useful for predicting quality of grains from an user input image that is captured through the mobile camera or from an uploaded image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furtherly, this notebook has two sections which explains about the working principle of two models:\n",
    "1.   Classification (For predicting a valid input image from the user).\n",
    "2.   Detection (For detecting number of grains and classifying each inside the image based on the sub-categories).\n",
    "***\n",
    "***Notebook procedures and operations***:\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "*   As a preliminary procedure, ensure whether you are connected to a runtime/kernel for this notebook. Runtime helps in executing the python code within the notebook. This you can view it on the right top corner of this notebook.\n",
    "*   Often use **Shift & Enter(Return)** together for executing the code snippets of this notebook.\n",
    "*   Incase if the kernel is stopped restart the kernel for executing this code.\n",
    "*  Give appropriate inputs while you are making an inference, if you are giving unappropriate inputs then you will get an error message.\n",
    "* For each and every successful inference, a copy of results will be saved in the detections results directory.\n"
